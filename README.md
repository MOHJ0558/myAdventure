## A simple little game written in Python.

Hi, I'm Andy Chen, and this simple game is my first Python project.
I (may) keep updating on this and make it more intresting.
But for now it's just include 3 rooms(paths), with different scenes and "portals".	
I'll make it better :D
BTW, I'll made this open-sourced, and I'll publish it to Github, because I love the feeling of open-source.
Hope you like it :)
