Hi, I'm Andy Chen, and this simple game is my first Python project.
I (may) keep updating on this and make it more intresting.
But for now it's just include 2 rooms(paths), with different scenes and "portals".	
(And, I also added a little cheat for you to play with.)
BTW, I'll made this open-sourced, and I'll publish it to Github, because I love the feeling of open-source.
Hope you like it :)
